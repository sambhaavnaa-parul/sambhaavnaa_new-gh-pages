			<strong class="color1"> Environmental Justice </strong>
			<br><br><br>
			<p> The unprecedented destruction and degradation of the our environment is affecting the very survival of millions of people. While understanding the ecological crisis of our times the concept of environmental injustice recognises the fact that some communities especially the working class and indigenous groups are disproportionately subjected to higher levels of environmental risk than other segments of society.</p>

			<br><br><br>
			<strong class="color2"> Political Justice </strong>
			<br><br><br>
			<p> That the current political and governance system which has been based on the principles of democracy has been corrupted and captured by the elite class at the cost of the large majority. That the emerging systems are thus centralising rather than decentralising political power and democracy has been compromised as a result of this. That social and economic inequalities perpetuate political injustice and vice versa. </p>

			<strong class="color3"> Social Justice </strong>
			<br><br><br>
			<p> Our society and its institutions are plagued by social injustice manifested or evident in the discrimination based on caste, class, gender, race, religion and region. That there is a dominant majority in each community and institution that perpetuates this injustice through a variety of tools the main being socialisation and conditioning through social institutions. </p>

			<br><br><br>
			<strong class="color4"> Economic Justice </strong>
			<br><br><br>
			<p> Our economy which is based on a model of â€œprimitive accumulation of capital', is structured to serve the interests of the dominant class, the elite and the new middle class. That this process has marginalised and deprived a large majority access and control over resources. This has led to increasing poverty and inequal as well as inequitable distribution of wealth which translates as economic injustice. </p>

			<br><br><p class="coltext"> <strong>We, at Sambhaavnaa, believe that there is an overlap in the hegemonisation process across the social, political and economic structures with the emergence of a rich, powerful and dominant class serving its own interest rather than that of the larger polity and society.</strong> </p>

			<p class="postersHeader"> Our Philosophy and Vision</p>
			<p class="coltext"> Set in the village of Kandwari, in the lap of the mighty Dhauladhar mountain ranges in Himachal Pradesh, is a unique learning and living space for those concerned with social and political change. The <strong>Sambhaavnaa Institute of Public Policy and Politics</strong> was founded under aegis of the Kumud Bhushan Education Society in 2004. Our main mission is to nurture value-based leadership by encouraging individuals, especially the youth; to reflect, discuss and develop a critical perspective on the ideals and ideas that define a just society.<br><br>
<strong>Our Beliefs:</strong><br><br><br>
We, at Sambhaavnaa believe, that that there is a need to question and challenge this dominance and radically change the structure and functioning of the society, polity and the economy to serve public interest with the principles of equality, justice and freedom.<br><br><br>
<strong>This change has three essential components:</strong><br><br>
<strong>-</strong> Strengthening of Resistance and Political Action<br>
<strong>-</strong> Supporting and Working on Creation of Alternatives (across the socio-economic-political models/institutions)<br>
<strong>-</strong> Bringing about Personal Transformation<br><br><br>
<strong>We understand that in society, spaces of knowledge creation, exchange and dissemination, are dominated by educational insitutions, the media and other mainstream systems which do not encourage the above. Infact these institutions create knowledge and impart it in a manner that aims to maintain status quo and rather than bring change. Further, subjects on which knowledge is to be built are chosen in a way that keep the attention of critical issues of injustice.</strong><br><br>
Sambhaavnaa is an alternative educational and learning space because through our programs we aim to:<br><br>
<strong>-</strong> facilitate collaboration, exchange and innovation in strategies and actions for change<br>
<strong>-</strong> facilitate perspective building for those engaged in transformative action<br>
<strong>-</strong> facilitate the building of a politically conscious citizenry especially youth<br>
<strong>-</strong> facilitate the process of personal transformation<br></p>
