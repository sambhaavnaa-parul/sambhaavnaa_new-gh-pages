Mostly, participants divide themselves in groups and take turns to do the work.<br><br>

			<p class="postersHeader"> Environmental Guidelines for Guests/Visitors to the Sambhaavnaa Institute campus </p>
			<p class="coltext"> <strong>In its efforts to create as environmentally sustainable a campus as possible, the Sambhaavnaa Institute asks all guests, whether brief visitors or long-term course participants, to abide by the following environmental guidelines whilst at the campus. We provide suggestions below on how to shop and prepare before coming in order to follow these guidelines.</strong><br><br>

<strong>Waste:</strong> Our ability and desire to manage waste/material discards is limited, so we generally discourage the leaving of any waste discards during your stay at Sambhaavnaa. We encourage you to firstly take steps to avoid creating waste by avoiding buying packaged products – both before you come and during your stay. Secondly, for whatever discards you do generate, we request you to please carry them out with you when you leave.<br><br><br>

<strong>We do allow deposit of the following materials, in separate bins in the hostel entryway labelled accordingly:</strong><br><br>
<strong>clean paper</strong>; we will take it to a nearby paper recycling unit<br>
<strong>biodegradable materials</strong>; e.g. dust, hair, soiled paper etc.<br>
<strong>re-usable object</strong>; leave useful, clean things you no longer need or want that may be re-used by someone else, and take things left by others<br><br><br>

<strong>Plastic waste:</strong> There is no way to safely or benignly manage plastic discards. As such, Sambhaavnaa has decided to implement a policy for visitors/guests to the campus (short or long-term) that both discourages the import onto campus, and disallows the leaving behind of, plastic. Please pack out whatever you pack in. We also kindly request that guests refrain from buying plastic packaged 'junk food' items off campus during the duration of their program, in order to minimize the envioronmental impact on the village. We gratefully appreciate your cooperation with this policy, and hope that the sensibility and need for it are understandable. <br><br>

<strong>-</strong>One exception we allow is <strong>disposal of sanitary napkins</strong>. Please deposit these only in bins in the toilets. Please do not put anything else into these bins.<br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Please consider using biodegradable and/or washable cloth napkins. These are available in some organic product shops or online (see for example:<a href="http://www.aakarinnovations.com/#!anandi/c10d6">Aakar Innovations</a>)<br><br>

<strong>Tips on how to avoid and/or minimize your accumulation of waste/plastics, which will help in preparing for your stay at our campus and complying with our non-plastics policy:</strong><br><br><br>

Avoid plastic-packaged foods or other products when shopping; Instead, try to buy local whole-foods in bulk whenever possible, using cloth or other re-useable bags, tiffins/tins/jars, etc.<br><br>

Please reject styrofoam/thermocol disposable cups and plates whilst travelling around the region. You might consider carrying your own reusable cup for things like chai, in case only thermocol and other plastic cups are available Simple steel cups are widely available in the market. Bamboo is another good lightweight, sturdy option. <br><br>

Please bring a refillable bottle (we recommend durable ones made of materials other than plastics or aluminium), and refill your bottle with the filtered water available on campus.<br><br>

Polyethylene carry bags (commonly called 'poly bags') are officially banned in Himachal. Please remind shopkeepers of this if they try to give you one and remember to carry your own cloth bags. The 'alternative' bags that shopkeepers here distribute are also made of plastic – polypropylene – and are also environmentally problematic. Please avoid them too if possible.<br><br><br>

<strong>Save water:</strong> Though we are fortunate to be located at the base of a mountain range that still provides consistent, clean water, the pressures on that water from development are ever increasing. Thus we request guests to help us conserve water on campus: <br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Turn taps off when not in use and take short showers.<br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Use natural, biodegradable detergents/soaps. The least toxic laundry soap widely available in local shops is unpackaged, brown or white bars. Non-chemcial, herbal soaps and shampoos are also available in many places, including khadi shops.<br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Avoid synthetic chemical cosmetics, lotions, and other such products which will pollute the water when they are washed off.<br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Do not throw anything into toilets, including tissue paper (which can clog drains), and especially non-biodegradable or toxic materials. <br><br>

<strong>Save energy:</strong> In Himachal, electricity comes mostly from hydropower dams on rivers, which have a range of environmental and social harms. Thus, whatever we can do to reduce consumption of energy will also reduce pressure on rivers. Also, Himachal's glaciers are rapidly receding due mainly to greenhouse gas emissions from combustion of fossil fuels. To address these pressing issues, we ask you to:<br><br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Turn lights and other uses of electricity off when not in use. <br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Walk or ride a bicycle whenever possible.<br><br>

<strong>-</strong>Share jeeps and taxis.<br><br>


<strong>Thank you for cooperating in making Sambhaavnaa a model of an environmentally responsible institute!</strong>
